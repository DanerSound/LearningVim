# LearningVim

****I want to learn vim or I will die trying****

## Install vim

**Debian**: `sudo apt install vim`

## Navigations

Rule #1: *Never use arrow keys.*

From now on i disable the up, down, left, right arrow and I will use only the h, j, k, l.

```
To move the cursor, press the h,j,k,l keys as indicated. 
             ^
             k              Hint:  The h key is at the left and moves left.
       < h       l >               The l key is at the right and moves right.
             j                     The j key looks like a down arrow.
             v
```
